# Why People Really Quit Their Jobs? 

### Master's End Project in KSchool - VII Edition - 
#### by María Gamero

# Study purpose

In order to retain highly talented individuals, many companies spend a great amount of time money investigating the causes of employee turnover. Usually the intent behind such studies is to find out why people leave—the idea being that if a company can identify the reasons for terminations, it can work to hold terminations, and turnover, down.

The project will be addressed to analize and understand in detail: 

 - #### **Analyze what are the features of the employees who leave the company**
 - #### **From the point of view of the company, detect which are the ones that the company is interested in retaining**
 - #### **Using machine learning tools, try to predict whether the employee will leave the company or not**
