# Why People Really Quit Their Jobs?

### Master's End Project in KSchool - VII Edition -

# Study purpose

In order to retain highly talented individuals, many companies spend a great amount of time money investigating the causes of employee turnover. Usually the intent behind such studies is to find out why people leave—the idea being that if a company can identify the reasons for terminations, it can work to hold terminations, and turnover, down.

The project will be addressed to analize and understand in detail: 

 - #### **What is the profile of the employees that are leaving prematurely their jobs?**
 - #### **Using machine learning tools, try to predict which valuable employees will leave next**
